# Portfolio Chat Avatar Web

An interactive personal portfolio website featuring a custom AI chat service. Users can explore my professional background, experience, and recommendations by chatting directly with an AI-powered avatar that responds based on my LinkedIn profile, summary, and other personal documents. The website communicates with a separate chat service repo [Github-profile-avatar-chat](https://github.com/MBronowicki/profile-avatar-chat) deployed on Hugging Face Spaces for live interaction. Built with Python, Gradio, OpenAI API, and LangSmith for traceable conversation insights.
